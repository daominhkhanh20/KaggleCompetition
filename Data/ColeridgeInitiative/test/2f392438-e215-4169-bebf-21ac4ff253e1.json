[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This report describes how the education system in the United States compares with education systems in the other Group of Eight (G-8) countries-Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the russian Federation, the United Kingdom-that are among the world's most economically developed countries and among the United States' largest economic partners. Comparative Indicators of Education in the United States and Other G-8 Countries: 2009 draws on the most current information about education from four primary sources: the Indicators of National Education Systems (INES) at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); the Progress in International reading Literacy Study (PIrLS); the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA); and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Begun in 2002, the series is published on a biennial basis. It should be noted that most of the indicators in this report do not contain data for the complete set of G-8 countries. This is the result of a G-8 country not reporting data or not participating in a study. Also, the United Kingdom participated as one country in PISA, but in PIrLS and TIMSS England and Scotland participated as individual systems. Similarly, Canada participated as separate provinces in PIrLS 2006. Indicators that use PIrLS and TIMSS as data sources report England and Scotland separately. Indicators that use PIrLS data present results for the participating Canadian provinces in appendix tables (see appendix B). Thus, in indicators using PIrLS data and discussed in the summary that follows, the \"participating\" G-8 countries include England, France, Germany, Italy, the russian Federation, Scotland, and the United States. In indicators using TIMSS data, \"participating\" G-8 countries include England, Germany, Italy, Japan, the russian Federation, Scotland, and the United States at fourth grade, and England, Italy, Japan, the russian Federation, Scotland, and the United States at eighth grade. 1 In indicators using INES data, the \"reporting\" G-8 countries vary somewhat; these are shown in each indicator and noted in the summary. The main findings of this report are summarized below. These highlights are organized around the five major sections of the report-population and school enrollment; academic performance; context for learning; expenditure for education; and education returns: educational attainment and income."}, {"section_title": "Population and School Enrollment School-age population", "text": "In 2008, the population of 5-to 29-year-olds (roughly the population most likely to be enrolled in education) represented 34 percent of the total population in the United States. In the other G-8 countries, the corresponding percentages ranged from 25 percent in Italy to 33 percent in the russian Federation. From 1998 to 2008, the United States had the largest net percentage gain in population size of 5-to 29-year-olds (6 percent) among the G-8 countries (indicator 1)."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment in formal education", "text": "In 2006, all or almost all 3-and 4-year-old children were enrolled in preprimary or primary education in France and Italy. 2 In Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan, at least 80 percent of 3-and 4-year-olds were enrolled; in the United States, 48 percent were enrolled. Compulsory education ends at age 18 in Germany; age 17 in the United States; age 16 in Canada, France, and the United Kingdom; and age 15 in Italy, Japan, and the russian Federation (indicator 2). 3 "}, {"section_title": "Foreign students in postsecondary education", "text": "In 2006, G-8 countries hosted close to two-thirds of all foreign students in higher education. 4 The United States received the largest percentage of these foreign students (20 percent), followed by the United Kingdom (11 percent), Germany (9 percent), and France (9 percent) (indicator 3)."}, {"section_title": "Academic Performance Reading", "text": "On the PIrLS 2006 assessment, fourth-graders in the russian Federation outperformed their peers in all other participating In PISA, students reported if they were native (born in the country of assessment with at least one of their parents born in the same country), or had an immigrant background within two generations. Students not reporting native also reported if they were second generation (born in the country of assessment but with parents born in another country), or first generation (born in another country and with parents born in another country). In all of the G-8 countries except the russian Federation, 15-year-old second-and first-generation students scored lower on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale compared to their native peers (indicator 13)."}, {"section_title": "Context for Learning", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Reading instruction", "text": "There are three indicators pertaining to reading instruction (indicators 14-16) that use teacher-reported data from PIrLS. In 2006, fourth-grade teachers' reports of the average number of hours spent on reading instruction each week generally varied widely both across countries and within countries (indicator 14). In three G-8 countries (England, Germany, and Italy), the highest percentages of fourth-graders had teachers who reported spending 3 hours or less on reading instruction per week. In two G-8 countries (France and the russian Federation), teachers most frequently cited spending over 3 hours but not more than 6 hours on reading instruction. The United States was the only participating G-8 country in which the majority of fourth-graders had teachers who reported spending more than 6 hours on reading instruction per week (68 percent) (indicator 14). In 2006, one of the most common strategies for assisting students having difficulty reading was to ask parents to help their child with reading. A second strategy commonly used was working with students individually. When asked about access to remedial reading specialists, 34 percent of fourth-graders in the United States and 24 percent of fourth-graders in England had teachers who reported always having a remedial reading specialist available. Less than 10 percent of fourth-graders in France, Germany, and Italy had teachers who reported always having a remedial reading specialist available. England had the lowest percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers never had access to a remedial reading specialist (16 percent), while Italy had the highest (95 percent). In the United States, 29 percent of fourth-graders had teachers who reported never having access to a remedial reading specialist (indicator 15)."}, {"section_title": "SUMMArY v", "text": "Among the G-8 countries, the only measurable difference from 2001 to 2006 in the percentage of fourth-graders with teachers reporting their age as 50 years or older was in the United States, where it was 12 percentage points lower in 2006 compared to 2001. The reported average years of teaching experience declined by 3 years in France, Germany, and the United States during this time period. In 2006, teachers of fourth-graders in England and the United States reported an average of 12 years of teaching experience (at all grades). This was lower than in all other participating G-8 countries, where teaching experience ranged from an average of 15 years in France to 22 years in Italy and the russian Federation (indicator 16)."}, {"section_title": "Teachers' working time", "text": "In 2006, teachers in the United States at the primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary levels were contracted to teach 1,080 hours during the school year. 7 Teachers in the United States were contracted to teach more hours than their peers in the other reporting G-8 countries (France, Germany, Italy, the russian Federation, and Scotland). However, U.S. teachers worked less total hours than their peers in Japan and Germany when working time was defined not only as time spent on teaching but also as time spent on other work-related activities (indicator 17)."}, {"section_title": "Teacher professional development in mathematics and science", "text": "There are indicators pertaining to teacher professional development in mathematics (indicator 18) and science (indicator 19) that use teacher-reported data from TIMSS. In 2007, the percentage of students whose teachers reported participating in professional development in mathematics content in the previous 2 years ranged from 22 percent in Italy to 66 percent in the russian Federation at fourth grade and 16 percent in Italy to 84 percent in the russian Federation at eighth grade; in the United States, the percentages were 60 percent at fourth grade and 81 percent at eighth grade. The percentage of students whose teachers reported participating in professional development in mathematics assessment ranged from 14 percent in Italy to 55 percent in the russian Federation at fourth grade and 17 percent in Italy to 71 percent in Scotland at eighth grade; in the United States, the percentages were 47 percent at fourth grade and 69 percent at eighth grade (indicator 18). The percentage of students whose teachers reported participating in professional development in science content in the previous 2 years ranged from 16 percent in Italy to 58 percent in the russian Federation at fourth grade and 24 percent in Italy to 82 percent in the United States at eighth grade. The percentage of students whose teachers reported participating in professional development in science on improving students' critical thinking or problem-solving skills ranged from 11 percent in Japan to 47 percent in Scotland at fourth grade and 10 percent in Italy to 73 percent in the United States at eighth grade. Compared to their participating G-8 peers, the United States had a greater percentage of eighth-graders whose science teachers reported participating in these two areas of professional development (indicator 19). School principals' uses of summative achievement data results from PISA indicate that in 2006, at least 90 percent of 15-year-old students in the United States and the United Kingdom had principals who reported that school achievement data were posted publicly (e.g., in the media). This compares to 75 percent of students in the russian Federation, 64 percent in Canada, and 33 percent in Italy. In Germany and Japan, 14 and 11 percent of students, respectively, had principals who reported that school achievement data were posted publicly. A greater percentage of 15-year-olds in the United States than in all other reporting G-8 countries had principals who reported that school achievement data were used in decisions about instructional resource allocation to the school; in the United States, 79 percent of students had principals who reported this use. At least 90 percent of students in Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the russian Federation had principals who reported that school achievement data were tracked over time by an administrative authority (such as a district, state, or national education agency (indicator 20)."}, {"section_title": "Frequency of behavior problems", "text": "results from TIMSS indicate that in 2007, the percentage of eighth-graders in schools whose principals reported at least a weekly occurrence of a classroom disturbance ranged from 8 percent in Japan to 60 percent in Scotland, with the United States at 55 percent. The percentage of eighth-graders in schools whose principals reported at least a weekly occurrence of intimidation or verbal abuse of other students ranged from 1 percent in the russian Federation to 39 percent in the United States, with the U.S. percentage higher than in all other participating G-8 countries (indicator 21)."}, {"section_title": "Expenditure for Education", "text": "Public school teachers' starting salaries Of the G-8 countries reporting data in 2006 (England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Scotland, and the United States), Germany reported the highest average starting salary of public school teachers at both the primary and upper secondary levels, followed by the United States. In most G-8 countries in 2006 (Germany being the exception), public school teachers at the beginning of their careers earned less than the average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in their respective countries (indicator 22)."}, {"section_title": "B5.", "text": "Percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported employing specific strategies for assisting students having difficulty reading,  Table  Page Introduction IntroductIon With the long-term growth in the trade of goods and services in the global economy, policymakers have turned to international comparisons to assess how well national systems of education are performing. these comparisons shed light on a host of issues, including access to education, equity of resources, and outcomes such as educational attainment and performance on standardized tests. they provide the opportunity to compare different aspects of countries' education systems, assess these systems' performance, and identify potential strategies to improve student achievement and system outputs. Since the 1960s, the united States has participated actively in international projects that are designed to provide key information about the performance of the u.S. education system relative to education systems in other countries. these projects include the Indicators of national Education Systems (InES) at the organization for Economic cooperation and development (oEcd); the Progress in International reading Literacy Study (PIrLS); the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA); and the trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (tIMSS). this report, Comparative Indicators of Education in the United States and Other G-8 Countries: 2009, draws on the most current information available from most of these projects at the time the report was being produced (in the summer and fall of 2008) to present a set of education indicators that describes how the u.S. education system compares with education systems in other economically developed countries. updated information from these various projects will be incorporated in subsequent reports. Although the international education projects cited above involve many countries worldwide, the comparisons in this report focus on the Group of Eight (G-8) countries: canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the russian Federation, the united Kingdom, and the united States. these are among the most industrialized countries in the world. the G 8 countries were selected as a comparison group because of the similarities in their economic development and because the other G-8 countries are among the major economic partners of the united States. the leaders of these countries meet regularly to discuss economic and other policy issues. What 's New in 2009? this report is the fourth in a series of reports published by the national center for Education Statistics (ncES) that describes how the education system in the united States compares with education systems in the other G-8 countries. It is the first of these reports to include data from all three international assessments of students in which the united States regularly participates-PIrLS, PISA, and tIMSS. the indicators use 2006 data from PIrLS and PISA and 2007 data from tIMSS. Many of the indicators in this report are updates of previous indicators that used data from earlier cycles, such as tIMSS 1999 and PIrLS 2001. there are also a few new PIrLS indicators-one presenting data using the PIrLS international performance benchmarks, another reporting the amount of time spent on reading instruction at school, and another highlighting trends in teacher preparation and experience. the PISA indicators, in particular, offer a unique contribution to the series of Comparative Indicators reports. PISA is a system of international assessments that measures 15-year-old students' performance in reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy every 3 years. Although all three of these subject areas are assessed in each PISA data collection effort, one is assessed in depth (i.e., is considered the major subject area) on a rotating basis. the major subject area in 2000 (when PISA was initiated) was reading literacy; in 2003, it was mathematics literacy. thus, prior Comparative Indicators reports have focused on 15-year-old students' reading and mathematics performance. the current report features indicators pertaining to students' science performance, as assessed in the most recent (2006) study. the 2008 edition of Education at a Glance, which presents international education data compiled by oEcd, was used largely to update several indicators that have been presented previously. However, this resource was also used to produce a new indicator in this report: teachers' working time."}, {"section_title": "Education Levels Used for the Indicators", "text": "Many of the indicators in this report refer to at least one of the following education levels: preprimary education, primary education, secondary education, and higher education. A brief overview of the education levels is presented here to provide the reader with a frame of reference while reading the indicators (see appendix A for more detailed descriptions). to ensure comparability in the indicators across countries, each country restructured its national education data to correspond with the definitions of education levels that were developed in the 1997 revision of the International Standard classification of Education (IScEd97) (united nations Educational, Scientific and cultural organization [unESco] 1997). the following descriptions highlight the key features of (1) education programs from preprimary through secondary education and (2) higher education programs. Preprimary education includes programs of education for children at least 3 years of age that involve organized, center-based instructional activities; in most countries, preprimary education is not compulsory. Primary education includes programs that are designed to give students a sound basic education in reading, writing, and mathematics, along with an elementary understanding of other subjects, such as history, geography, science, art, and music. In the international classification, primary education usually begins at the start of compulsory education (around age 6) and lasts for 6 years. Secondary education encompasses two stages: lower secondary education and upper secondary education. Lower secondary education includes programs that are designed to complete basic education; the standard duration in the international classification is 3 years. Upper secondary education is designed to provide students with more in-depth knowledge of academic or vocational subjects and to prepare them for higher level academic or vocational studies or entry into the labor market. The standard duration of upper secondary education in the international classification is 3 years. Higher education includes tertiary programs 1 that fall into three main categories: Academic higher education below the doctoral level. \u2022 These largely theory-based programs are intended to provide sufficient qualifications to gain entry into advanced research programs and professions with high skill requirements. To be classified as such, a degree program must last at least 3 years and is typically preceded by at least 13 years of formal schooling. In the United States, bachelor's, master's, and first professional degree programs are classified at this level. Vocational higher education. \u2022 These programs provide a higher level of career and technical education and are designed to prepare students for the labor market. In the international classification, these programs last 2 to 4 years. In the United States, associate's degree programs are classified at this level. Doctoral level of academic higher education. \u2022 These programs usually require the completion of a research thesis or dissertation. The international classification also includes an education level that straddles the boundary between upper secondary and higher education: postsecondary nontertiary education. These programs of study-which are primarily vocational in nature-are generally taken after the completion of upper secondary education. They are often not significantly more advanced than upper secondary programs, but they serve to broaden the knowledge of participants who have already completed upper secondary education. In the United States, these programs are often in the form of occupationally specific vocational certificate programs, such as 1-year certification programs offered at technical institutes or community colleges. 2 Mapping G-8 Countries' Education Systems to the ISCED97 Matching the education levels of individual countries to the ISCED97 classification can be challenging, because the particulars of individual countries seldom fit ISCED97 perfectly. Using ISCED97 classifications as a starting point, NCES worked with education professionals in other G-8 countries to create a general overview of each country's education system. As an aid to the reader, schematics of how the ISCED97 applies to each of the G-8 countries are provided in appendix A, accompanied by text describing each system in greater detail."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Report", "text": "The report begins with a summary section that highlights key findings; it then presents 27 indicators that compare different aspects of the education system in the United States to education systems in other G-8 countries. The indicators are organized into the following sections: population and school enrollment; \u2022 academic performance, with subsections for reading, mathemat-\u2022 ics, and science; context for learning; \u2022 expenditure for education; and \u2022 education returns: educational attainment and income. \u2022 The first section, population and school enrollment, presents indicators that suggest the potential demand for education in countries as measured by the size and growth of their school-age population and current levels of enrollment in formal education. The section concludes with an indicator that examines the extent to which foreign students are enrolled in higher education across the G-8 countries. The next section, academic performance, has indicators grouped by subject area into three subsections: reading, mathematics, and science. The indicators present findings on student performance in the G-8 countries, including achievement differences across key demographic variables such as sex, parent occupational status, and immigrant status. The third section highlights a range of key policy-relevant issues pertaining to the context for learning across the G-8 countries. For example, using data as reported by school teachers, there are indicators pertaining to the amount of time devoted to reading instruction, strategies used to assist students who have fallen behind in reading, trends in teacher preparation and experience, teachers' working time, and teacher professional development in mathematics and science. This section also presents the reports of school principals on the uses of summative achievement data and the frequency of student behavior problems. The fourth section provides a comparative look at expenditure for education, including breakdowns by expenditure as a percentage of a country's gross domestic product (GDP) and an indicator on public school teacher salaries in primary and secondary education. The final section, education returns: educational attainment and income, focuses on educational attainment, employment rates, and earnings (including breakdowns by sex and field of study). Each indicator is presented in a two-page format. The first page presents key findings that highlight how the United States compares with its G-8 peers (with data available) on the issue examined in the indicator. The key findings are followed by a section that defines the terms used in the indicator and describes key features of the methodology used to produce it. The second page presents graphical depictions of the data that support the key findings. These tables and/or figures also include the specific data source for the indicator and more detailed notes on interpreting the data."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "There are four main sources of data for this report: Data from the INES project come from tables in Education at a Glance: OECD Indicators 2008 or from OECD's online Education Database. These data are derived from annual data collections carried out by OECD, with member countries' data coming from a variety of national data sources, including administrative data collections, school surveys, household surveys, and national financial reports. Most of the indicator data for the United States come from the Current Population Survey (CPS) of the U.S. Census Bureau, the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD), the NCES Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), and the NCES Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS)."}, {"section_title": "PIRLS 2006 data. \u2022", "text": "PIrLS is conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) and is an assessment of fourth-graders in reading literacy.

Data for indicator 1, on school-age population, are from the International Data Base (IDB) of the U.S. Census Bureau. Throughout this report, student data are often presented. Some indicators show the mean scores of students (e.g., indicators 5 and 10), \u2022 the percentage of students meeting certain criteria, such as \u2022 the percentage of students reaching established achievement benchmarks (e.g., indicators 6 and 11), or the percentage of students with particular characteristics, \u2022 such as the percentage of students by immigrant status (indicator 13). Other indicators also use the student as the unit of analysis, but the data are reported from other sources. These include school principals, such as the percentage of students whose \u2022 principals reported that they used summative achievement data in various ways (indicator 20) or teachers, such as the percentage of students whose teachers \u2022 reported participating in various professional development activities (indicators 18 and 19). In several other indicators, the unit of analysis is not the student. For example, the unit of analysis may be the teacher, as in public school teachers' salaries (indicator 22) \u2022 or postsecondary degrees, as in first university degrees by field of \u2022 study (indicator 25). When interpreting the data presented in this report, it is important for readers to be aware of limitations based on the source of information and problems that may exist in verifying comparability in reporting. Except for indicator 22, which explicitly states that the data pertain to public school teachers only, the indicators in this report include data from both public and private schools."}, {"section_title": "Availability of Country Data", "text": "It should be noted that many of the indicators in this report do not contain data for the complete set of G-8 countries. That is, specific countries are sometimes not included or are only partially included in an indicator. This is the result of source data not being reported, or specific countries or jurisdictions within a country not participating in a particular survey. For example, Japan did not participate in PIrLS 2006, France did not participate in TIMSS 2007, and Germany did not participate in TIMSS 2007 at the eighth grade; therefore, these countries do not appear in indicators using these data. Two other countries that warrant special mention include Canada and the United Kingdom. Canada participated as a unified country in PISA 2006, and in this report, data for Canada are shown and discussed in the PISA indicators. However, in PIrLS 2006, Canada participated as separate provinces. In this report, results for the Canadian provinces are not reported in the PIrLS indicators; rather, they can be found in the appendix tables (see appendix B). In TIMSS 2007, some Canadian provinces took part in the study as benchmarking participants. These findings do not appear in this report, but they can be found in the international reports published by IEA (Mullis, Martin, and Foy 2008;Martin, Mullis, and Foy 2008). The United Kingdom, which includes England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, participated in PISA 2006. However, in PIrLS 2006and TIMSS 2007 England and Scotland participated, and they participated as separate jurisdictions. Northern Ireland and Wales did not participate in PIrLS 2006or TIMSS 2007 In this report, the PISA indicators include data for the United Kingdom, and the PIrLS and TIMSS indicators include data for England and Scotland shown separately. Thus, as discussed in indicators using PIrLS data, the participating G-8 countries include England, France, Germany, Italy, the russian Federation, Scotland, and the United States. In indicators using TIMSS data, participating G-8 countries include England, Germany, Italy, Japan, the russian Federation, Scotland, and the United States at fourth grade, and England, Italy, Japan, the russian Federation, Scotland, and the United States at eighth grade. 3 In indicators using INES data, the reporting G-8 countries vary somewhat; these are shown in each indicator. While every effort was made to use the most up-to-date data available across the G-8 countries (usually from 2006 or 2007), data from earlier years were sometimes used if more recent data were not available. To make this clear to the reader, these occurrences are noted in relevant tables and figures."}, {"section_title": "Data Quality and Response Rates", "text": "PIrLS, PISA, and TIMSS have established technical standards of data quality including participation and response rate standards that countries must meet in order to be included in the comparative results. response rate standards were set using composites of response rates at the school, classroom, student, and teacher levels, and response rates were calculated with and without the inclusion of substitute schools that were selected to replace schools refusing to participate. 4 These standards are described in detail in the technical reports (Martin, Mullis, and Kennedy 2007;OECD 2009;Olson, Martin, and Mullis 2008). Consistent with NCES statistical standards, item response rates less than 85 percent are footnoted in the tables and figures of this report, as well as instances where reporting standards are not met because of too few observations to provide reliable estimates."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Testing", "text": "Ten of the indicators presented in this report (indicators 1, 2, 3, 17, and 22-27) are derived either from administrative records that are based on universe collections or from national sample surveys for which standard errors were not available. Consequently, for these indicators, no tests of statistical significance were conducted to establish whether observed differences from the U.S. average were statistically significant. However, for the 17 other indicators derived from PIrLS, PISA, or TIMSS data (indicators 4-16 and 18-21), standard t tests were calculated for comparisons of estimates within or between countries (e.g., to test whether a U.S. estimate is statistically different from other G-8 countries' estimates). Differences were reported if they were found to be statistically significant at the .05 level, using two-tailed tests of significance for comparisons of independent samples."}, {"section_title": "Other International Indicator Publications", "text": "Prior to this report, NCES produced three earlier reports-in 2006, 2004, and 2002-describing  In 2008, the total population across the G-8 countries ranged from 33.2 million in Canada to 303.8 million in the United States, and the population of 5-to 29-year-olds (roughly the population most likely to be enrolled in education) ranged from 10.4 million in Canada to 104.2 million in the United States (table 1). The population of 5-to 29-year-olds represented 34 percent of the total population in the United States (table 2). In the other G-8 countries, the corresponding percentages ranged from 25 percent in Italy to 33 percent in the russian Federation. From 1998 to 2008, the United States had the largest net percentage gain in population size of 5-to 29-year-olds (6 percent) among the G-8 countries (figure 1). The population of 5-to 29-year-olds declined in every other G-8 country except for Canada, with decreases from 1998 to 2008 ranging from 1 percent in the United Kingdom to 18 percent in Japan. In Canada, growth of this population was essentially flat (0.4 percent). The subpopulation of 5-to 19-year-olds (which generally includes individuals of primary-and secondary-school age) represented 20 percent of the total population in the United States in 2008 (table 2). The U.S. percentage was higher than the percentages in France,Germany,Italy,Japan,Russian Federation,United Kingdom,United States SCHOOL-AGE pOpULAtIOn all other G-8 countries, which ranged from 14 percent in Italy and Japan to 18 percent in France, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The United States was the only G-8 country to experience a net percentage gain in subpopulation size of 5-to 19-year-olds from 1998 to 2008 (3 percent) (figure 1). The population of 5-to 19-year-olds declined in all other G-8 countries, with decreases from 1998 to 2008 ranging from 1 percent in France to 32 percent in the russian Federation. The subpopulation of 20-to 29-year-olds (which generally includes individuals of postsecondary education age) represented 14 percent of the total population in the United States in 2008, below the percentage in the russian Federation (17 percent) (table 2). The percentages in the other G-8 countries were slightly lower than in the United States, ranging from 11 percent in Italy to 13 percent in Canada, the United Kingdom, and France. The russian Federation had the largest net percentage gain in subpopulation size of 20-to 29-year-olds, an increase of 14 percent from 1998 to 2008 (figure 1). The United States had the second largest net percentage gain in subpopulation size (11 percent). Among the other G-8 countries, Canada and the United Kingdom experienced a net percentage gain from 1998 to 2008 (7 and 1 percent, respectively), while the other G-8 countries experienced declines over this period, ranging from 5 percent in France to 28 percent in Italy."}, {"section_title": "Definitions and Methodology", "text": "In each country, the percentage of the population of 5-to 29-yearolds in 1998 and 2008 is calculated by dividing the population of 5-to 29-year-olds by the total population. The percentage change in the population of 5-to 29-year-olds is calculated by subtracting the population of 5-to 29-year-olds in 1998 from this population in 2008 and dividing by the 1998 population of 5-to 29-year-olds. These calculations are applied in the same way to the age groups 5 to 19 and 20 to 29. The age group (e.g., 5 to 29) as a percentage of the total population may have declined from 1998 to 2008 even though the size of the age group may have increased. This is because of a higher rate of increase of the total population compared to the rate of increase for the specific population age group.      In 2006, all or almost all 3-and 4-year-old children were enrolled in preprimary or primary education programs in France and Italy (table 3). In Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan, at least 80 percent of 3-and 4-year-olds were enrolled in preprimary or primary education programs; in the United States, 48 percent were enrolled. Beginning at age 6 in the United States and at age 7 in the russian Federation, at least 90 percent of the population was enrolled in formal education (figure 2). In 2006, the United States and most other reporting G-8 countries had nearly universal school participation of children ages 5-14-the age range that typically corresponds with primary and lower secondary education (table 3). In the russian Federation, 82 percent of 5-to 14-year-olds were enrolled in formal education programs; all other G-8 countries were at 98 percent participation or higher. The United States had an enrollment rate of 78 percent in 2006 for youth ages 15-19-the age range that corresponds most closely with upper secondary education. The U.S. rate was lower than the rates in Italy (81 percent), France (86 percent), and Germany (89 percent), but higher than the rates in the russian Federation (74 percent) and the United Kingdom (70 percent). Compulsory education ends at age 18 in Germany, age 17 in the United States, age 16 in France and the United Kingdom, and age 15 in Italy, Japan, and the russian Federation (figure 2). 5 While participation rates were at 90 percent or higher through the end of compulsory education in Italy, the russian Federation, France, and Japan, they fell below this level in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Enrollment rates for 20-to 29-year olds-the age range that corresponds most closely to the typical age of enrollment in higher education-were less than 30 percent among the six G-8 countries reporting data (table 3). The United States had an enrollment rate of 23 percent for this age range. The U.S. rate was lower than the rate in Germany (28 percent), but higher than the rates in Italy and France (both at 20 percent), the russian Federation (19 percent), and the United Kingdom (17 percent).\nThe percentage of the population at given ages enrolled in education is called an \"enrollment rate.\" In this indicator, the term \"enrollment rate\" refers to the \"net enrollment rate\" and is defined as the number of students in a particular age group enrolled in education divided by the population of that same age group. The reference year is 2006 for population and enrollment data in all countries except the russian Federation, which has a reference year of 2005. Enrollment rates may exceed 100 percent for some countries and some age categories largely because of different reference dates for school enrollment and population data. Enrollments include all full-time and part-time students in public and private institutions. Enrollment in preprimary education programs (generally the 3-to 4-year-old age group) includes only children in preschool, nursery, or center-based daycare programs and excludes children in daycare operated in homes. The ending age of compulsory education is the age at which individuals are no longer legally required to participate in formal education. 2   Table 3.

NOTE: Reference year is 2006 for population and enrollment data in all countries except the Russian Federation, as noted above; however, reference dates may differ within that year. Thus, percentages shown in the table are approximations. As described in the source cited below, enrollment rates for some countries were reported as slightly exceeding 100 percent in one or more age ranges (e.g., see 5-to 14-year-olds) due to different reference dates for school enrollment and population data. Enrollment in formal education at the preprimary education level includes children in center-based programs and excludes children in home-based early childhood education.

This age varies across states, ranging from 16 to 18; the modal age is 16 (Digest of Education Statistics, 2007, Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and France. Over the past 3 decades, the number of foreign students (i.e., students enrolled outside their country of citizenship) in higher education has grown almost fivefold: from 0.6 million worldwide in 1975 to 2.9 million in 2006 (OECD 2008a). In 2006, G-8 countries (as countries of destination) hosted close to two-thirds of all foreign students in higher education (figure 3a). The United States received the largest percentage of these foreign students (20 percent), followed by the United Kingdom (11 percent), Germany (9 percent), and France (9 percent). Altogether, in 2006, these four G-8 countries accounted for almost one-half of all foreign students enrolled in higher education. The other G-8 countries each took in between 2 and 5 percent of all foreign students enrolled in higher education. In addition to the share of foreign students hosted by each G-8 country, another measure can be examined that takes into account the size of a country's higher education system: the percentage of a country's students enrolled in higher education who are foreign students. Among the G-8 countries, the United States had the largest number of foreign students enrolled in higher education (OECD 2008a). However, in comparison to the United States, foreign students made up a larger percentage of enrollments in higher education in the United Kingdom (18 percent), Canada (15 percent), Germany (11 percent), and France (11 percent) (figure 3b). In the United States, nonresidents made up 3 percent of the total enrollment in higher education. 6 In the russian Federation, foreign students made up 1 percent of the total enrollment in higher education, lower than in all other G-8 countries.\nForeign students are defined as noncitizens enrolled in education programs in a host country, and thus some permanent residents are included. International students are defined as students who enrolled in institutions in other countries, and thus do not include permanent residents. As shown in the figures, education levels are defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97).

As defined by PIrLS, the 1st year of formal schooling begins with the 1st year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. Note that kindergarten is not counted. For most countries, the target grade was fourth grade, or its national equivalent. PIrLS scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the scale average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. Since the PIrLS reading achievement scales were designed to reliably measure student achievement over time, the metric of the scales was established originally with the 2001 assessment. In order to describe concretely the knowledge and skills attained along the performance scale, PIrLS 2006 established four international achievement benchmarks in reading literacy (low, intermediate, high, and advanced). These benchmarks are identical to the cutpoints used for the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Information about the rationale underlying the benchmarks and the procedures used to set the cutpoints is available in Martin, Mullis, and Kennedy (2007). Four points on the scales were identified for use as international benchmarks: 400 for the low benchmark, 475 for the intermediate benchmark, 550 for the high benchmark, and 625 for the advanced benchmark. These were selected to represent the range of performance shown by students internationally.  1 Met international guidelines for participation rates only after substitute schools were included. That is, to avoid sample size losses resulting from sampled schools not participating, a mechanism was instituted to identify, a priori, substitute schools that have similar characteristics to the sampled schools that they may replace. SOURCE: Mullis, I.V.S., Martin, M.O., Kennedy, A.M., and Foy, P. (2007) In 2006, average scores of fourth-grade females in reading literacy were higher than the average scores of fourth-grade males in all participating G-8 countries. Among countries with the largest score differences between males and females were Scotland (538 for females vs. 516 for males), with a difference of 22 points; England (549 for females vs. 530 for males), with a difference of 19 points; and the russian Federation (572 for females vs. 557 for males), with a difference of 15 points ( figure 5a and figure 5b). Among countries with the smallest differences related to sex were Germany (551 for females vs. 544 for males) and Italy (555 for females vs. 548 for males), both with a difference of 7 points. In the United States, females outperformed males by 10 points (545 for females vs. 535 for males).\nIn PIrLS 2006, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years.

SOURCE: Mullis, I.V.S., Martin, M.O., Kennedy, A.M., and Foy, P. (2007) On the TIMSS 2007 fourth-grade mathematics assessment, students in Japan outperformed students in the other participating G-8 countries, with higher percentages of Japanese fourth-graders reaching each of the four international benchmarks. The highest international benchmark, advanced, was reached by 23 percent of Japan's fourth-graders in mathematics, compared with percentages ranging from 4 percent in Scotland to 16 percent in the russian Federation and England (figure 6). In the United States, 10 percent of fourth-graders reached the advanced benchmark. The percentage in the United States was higher than in Germany, Italy, and Scotland, but lower than in the russian Federation, England, and Japan. In Japan, 61 percent of fourth-graders reached the high benchmark in mathematics; the percentages in the other G-8 countries ranged from 25 percent in Scotland to 48 percent in England and the russian Federation. In the United States, 40 percent of fourth-graders reached the high benchmark, a larger percentage than in Italy and Scotland but smaller than in England, the russian Federation, and Japan. As at fourth grade, eighth-graders in Japan outperformed their peers in the other participating G-8 countries, with higher percentages of Japanese eighth-graders reaching each of the four benchmarks. The advanced benchmark was reached by 26 percent of Japan's eighth-graders in mathematics, compared with percentages ranging from 3 percent in Italy to 8 percent in the russian Federation and England. In the United States, 6 percent of eighth-graders reached the advanced benchmark. The percentage in the United States was higher than in Scotland and Italy, but lower than in the russian Federation and Japan. In Japan, 61 percent of eighth-graders reached the high benchmark in mathematics; the percentages in the other G-8 countries ranged from 17 percent in Italy to 35 percent in England. In the United States, 31 percent of eighth-graders reached the high benchmark, a larger percentage than in Scotland and Italy.\nIn TIMSS 2007 at fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling (the end of primary school), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. At eighth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 8 years of formal schooling (the end of lower secondary education), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 13.5 years. TIMSS scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the scale average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. Since the TIMSS mathematics achievement scales were designed to reliably measure student achievement over time, the metric of the scales was established originally with the 1995 assessment. In order to describe concretely the knowledge and skills attained along the performance scales, TIMSS established four international achievement benchmarks in mathematics and science (low, intermediate, high, and advanced). Four points on the scales were identified for use as international benchmarks: 400 for the low benchmark, 475 for the intermediate benchmark, 550 for the high benchmark, and 625 for the advanced benchmark. These were selected to represent the range of performance shown by students internationally. At the fourth-grade level in mathematics, students at the low benchmark have some basic mathematical knowledge, such as an understanding of whole numbers and the properties of basic geometric shapes. At the intermediate benchmark, students can apply basic mathematical knowledge in straightforward situations, such as performing operations with 3-and 4-digit numbers and decimals and extending simple patterns. At the high benchmark, students can apply their knowledge and understanding to solve multistep word problems involving addition, multiplication, and division and problems requiring the use of data in tables and graphs. Students at the advanced benchmark can apply their understanding and knowledge in a wide variety of relatively complex situations to solve problems involving fractions, decimals, proportions, area, and rotation. At the eighth-grade level in mathematics, students at the low benchmark have some basic mathematical knowledge, such as the ability to do basic computations with whole numbers and reading information from a line on a graph. At the intermediate benchmark, students can apply basic mathematical knowledge in straightforward situations. For example, they can understand simple algebraic relationships, interpret graphs and tables, and perform basic computations to solve one-step word problems involving whole numbers and decimals. Students at the high benchmark can apply their understanding and knowledge in a wide variety of relatively complex situations to solve problems involving fractions, decimals, negative integers, proportions, area, volume, and probability. Students at the advanced benchmark can organize information, make generalizations, solve nonroutine problems, and draw and justify conclusions from data. For example, they can compute percent change, solve simultaneous linear equations, and model simple situations algebraically.\nIn TIMSS 2007 at fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling (the end of primary school), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years.

At the fourth-grade level in science, students at the low benchmark have some elementary knowledge of the Earth, life, and physical sciences, such as simple facts about magnets, electricity, and boiling. At the intermediate benchmark, students can apply basic knowledge and understanding to practical situations in the sciences, such as knowing some basic information about Earth's features and processes, human biology, and health. At the high benchmark, students can apply knowledge and understanding to explain everyday phenomena, such as demonstrating some knowledge of life processes, physical states, and chemical changes. Students at the advanced benchmark can apply knowledge and understanding in beginning scientific inquiry, such as classifying organisms according to major physical and behavioral features. At the eighth-grade level in science, students at the low benchmark recognize some basic facts from the life and physical sciences, including some knowledge about the human body and familiarity with some everyday physical phenomena. Students at the intermediate benchmark can recognize and communicate basic scientific knowledge across a range of topics, including the solar system, human health, and energy. Students at the high benchmark demonstrate conceptual understanding of some science cycles, systems, and principles. For example, they show some understanding of the structure and function of organisms, physical and chemical changes, and major environmental issues. At the advanced benchmark, students demonstrate a grasp of some complex and abstract science concepts. For example, they can apply understanding of the complexity of living organisms and how they relate to their environment.\nIn TIMSS 2007 at fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling (the end of primary school), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years.

That is, to avoid sample size losses resulting from sampled schools not participating, a mechanism was instituted to identify, a priori, substitute schools that have similar characteristics to the sampled schools that they may replace. For England, this applies to eighth-grade only. Average scores of 15-year-old students on the combined science literacy scale ranged from 475 in Italy to 534 in Canada, with the United States at 489 (figure 10). The U.S. average score was lower than the average score of 500 for the participating Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries (Baldi et al. 2007). Among the G-8 countries, the U.S. average score was lower than the average scores of the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and Canada; higher than the average score of Italy; and not measurably different from the average scores of the russian Federation and France. U.S. 15-year-olds scored lower, on average, than their peers in the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and Canada on the three science literacy subscales. The U.S. average score of 492 on the identifying scientific issues subscale was lower than the average scores of Germany (510), the United Kingdom (514), Japan 522, and Canada (532) (figure 10). However, students in the United States outperformed their peers in Italy (474) and the russian Federation (463) on this subscale. Among the G-8 countries, students in Canada had the highest score on the identifying scientific issues subscale. On the explaining phenomena scientifically subscale, 15-year-olds in Canada scored higher, on average, than their peers in all other G-8 countries except for Japan (there was no measurable difference between Canada and Japan on this subscale). U.S. students had an average score of 486 and were outperformed by students in the United Kingdom (517), Germany (519), Japan 527, and Canada (531). Unlike the identifying scientific issues subscale, U.S. students did not perform better, on average, than their peers in any other G-8 country on this subscale. On the using scientific evidence subscale, students in Japan and Canada scored higher, on average, than their peers in all other G-8 countries. U.S. students had an average score of 489 and were outperformed, on average, by students in France (511), the United Kingdom (514), Germany (515), Canada (542), and Japan (544). However, students in the United States outperformed their peers in Italy (467) on this subscale.\nIn PISA, \"15-year-olds\" refers to students between 15 years and 3 months to 16 years and 2 months old at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling. PISA defines scientific literacy as \"an individual's scientific knowledge and use of that knowledge to identify questions, to acquire new knowledge, to explain scientific phenomena, and to draw evidencebased conclusions about science-related issues, understanding of the characteristic features of science as a form of human knowledge and inquiry, awareness of how science and technology shape our material, intellectual, and cultural environments, and willingness to engage in science-related issues, and with the ideas of science, as a reflective citizen\" (OECD 2006, p. 12). In PISA 2006, students were assessed on their scientific literacy in relation to scientific knowledge or concepts, scientific processes, and situations or contexts, which were reflected in three subscales (identifying scientific issues, explaining phenomena scientifically, and using scientific evidence). The identifying scientific issues subscale includes recognizing issues that are possible to investigate scientifically; identifying keywords to search for scientific information; and recognizing the key features of a scientific investigation. The explaining phenomena scientifically subscale includes applying knowledge of science in a given situation; describing or interpreting phenomena scientifically and predicting changes; and identifying appropriate descriptions, explanations, and predictions. The using scientific evidence subscale includes interpreting scientific evidence and making and communicating conclusions; identifying the assumptions, evidence, and reasoning behind conclusions; and reflecting on the societal implications of science and technological developments. Scores on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the OECD average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100.\nIn PISA, \"15-year-olds\" refers to students between 15 years and 3 months to 16 years and 2 months old at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling.

Scores on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the OECD average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. Science proficiency was defined in terms of six levels (levels 1 through 6) based on student performance scores on the combined science literacy scale. Exact cut point scores are as follows: level 6 (a score greater than 707.93); level 5 (a score greater than 633.33 and less than or equal to 707.93); level 4 (a score greater than 558.73 and less than or equal to 633.33); level 3 (a score greater than 484.14 and less than or equal to 558.73); level 2 (a score greater than 409.54 and less than or equal to 484.14); and level 1 (a score greater than 334.94 and less than or equal to 409.54). Students who perform below level 1 (a score less than or equal to 334.94) \"\u2026are unable to demonstrate science competencies in situations required by the easiest PISA tasks\u2026 such a low level of science competency can be regarded as putting them at a serious disadvantage for full participation in society and the economy\" (OECD 2007a, p. 42). In order to reach a particular proficiency level, a student must have been able to correctly answer a majority of items at that level. Students at each succeeding level are capable of solving science problems of increasing complexity. Students proficient at level 1 have such a limited scientific knowledge that it can only be applied to a few, familiar situations. They can present scientific explanations that are obvious and that follow explicitly from given evidence. Students at level 2 have adequate scientific knowledge to provide possible explanations or draw conclusions based on simple investigations; they are capable of direct reasoning and making literal interpretations of the results of scientific inquiry or technological problem solving. At level 3, students can identify clearly described scientific issues in a range of contexts; they can directly apply simple models or inquiry strategies to explain phenomena, interpret and use scientific concepts, and can make decisions based on scientific knowledge. At level 4, students can work effectively with situations that may involve explicit phenomena requiring them to make inferences about the role of science; they can select, integrate, and link explanations from different disciplines of science to real-world situations; they can reflect on their actions and can communicate decisions using scientific evidence. Students at level 5 can identify the scientific components of many complex real-world situations and can apply scientific concepts to these situations and evaluate scientific evidence; they can use well-developed inquiry abilities, bring critical insights to situations, and construct explanations based on evidence and arguments based on their critical analysis. Students proficient at level 6 clearly and consistently demonstrate advanced scientific thinking and reasoning, demonstrate willingness to use their scientific understanding in support of solutions to unfamiliar situations, and can develop real-world arguments based on scientific knowledge. For more information about how proficiency levels were set for PISA 2006, see the technical appendix in Baldi et al.

Scores on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the OECD average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. For more information about science literacy in PISA 2006, see the Definitions and Methodology section of indicators 10 and 11. Parent occupational status is measured by the Highest International Socioeconomic Index of Occupational Status (HISEI), which corresponds to the highest occupational index score of the student's father or mother. Parental occupation, as reported by the student, was coded based on the current version of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88) (International Labor Organization 1988). Occupational codes were, in turn, mapped onto an internationally comparable index of occupational status, the International Socioeconomic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI), developed by Ganzeboom, De Graaf, and Treiman (1992). The ISEI captures the attributes of occupations that convert parents' education into income. It is derived by optimally scaling occupation groups to maximize the indirect effect of education on income through occupation and to minimize the direct effect of education on income, net of occupation (both effects being net of age). As discussed in this indicator, students were also classified into national quarters on the ISEI. , which corresponds to the highest occupational index score of the student's father or mother. This information, derived from students' responses to questionnaire items pertaining to parental occupation, is transformed into an index developed by Ganzeboom, De Graaf, and Treiman (1992 (PISA 2006), this indicator compares 15-year-old students' science achievement by immigration status across the G-8 countries. In PISA 2006, the student background questionnaire asked 15-year-olds to report if they were native (born in the country of assessment with at least one of their parents born in the same country), or had an immigrant background within two generations. Students not reporting native also reported if they were second generation (born in the country of assessment but with parents born in another country), or first generation (born in another country and with parents born in another country). 16 In 2006, 15 percent of U.S. 15-year-olds had an immigrant background within two generations; of these, 9 percent reported being second generation students and 6 percent reported being first generation students (figure 13a). The U.S. percentage of students with an immigrant background within two generations (15 percent) was higher than the corresponding percentage for the russian Federation (9 percent), the United Kingdom (9 percent), Italy (4 percent), and Japan (0.4 percent), but lower than that for Canada (21 percent).\nIn PISA, \"15-year-olds\" refers to students between 15 years and 3 months to 16 years and 2 months old at the at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling. Students were tested in the language of instruction used in their school. Multilingual countries developed as many versions of the test instruments as there were languages of instruction used in the schools included in their national sample. PISA was designed to be as inclusive as possible. Each participating country attempted to maximize the coverage of 15-year-olds enrolled in education in its national sample so that results would be representative of the entire national school system. Thus, efforts were made to ensure that exclusions at the school or student level, if they were necessary, were minimized according to the PISA technical standards. Countries might find it necessary to reduce their coverage of the target population by excluding, for example, a small, remote geographical region due to inaccessibility. Instances where minority languages were used in only a very limited number of schools could be excluded from the target population if this was determined not to affect the overall quality of the data collection. Within schools, students could be excluded for being intellectually disabled, functionally disabled, or having insufficient language experience. Students were not to be excluded solely because of poor academic performance or normal discipline problems. With respect to insufficient language experience, students could be excluded only if they met the following three criteria: not being native speakers in the assessment language, having limited proficiency in the assessment language, and receiving less than 1 year of instruction in the assessment language. The sampling standards used in PISA permitted countries to exclude up to a total of 5 percent of the relevant population for approved reasons. All G-8 countries achieved this standard except for Canada, which had an overall exclusion rate of 6 percent. Canada's withinschool exclusion rate was 5 percent. In all other G-8 countries, the within-school exclusion rates ranged from 0 percent in Japan to 4 percent in the United States. (See OECD 2009 for additional details about exclusions, including procedures, criteria, and rates.) Scores on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000 with the OECD average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. For more information about science literacy in PISA 2006, see the Definitions and Methodology section of indicators 10 and 11. The computations presented in the text were carried out using unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from computations made using the rounded numbers that appear in figures 13a and 13b.

Using data from the 2006 Progress in International reading Literacy Study (PIrLS 2006), this indicator presents the reports of teachers of fourth-graders about how much time in a typical week they spend on reading instruction. As reported in this indicator, the average number of hours spent on reading instruction is grouped into three categories: 3 hours or less, more than 3 and up to and including 6 hours, and more than 6 hours. Teachers' reports of the average number of hours spent on reading instruction each week generally varied widely both across and within the participating G-8 countries 18 (figure 14). For example, in 2006, the percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported spending 3 hours or less in a typical week on reading instruction ranged from 10 percent in the United States to 71 percent in Germany. This category was reported more frequently than the other two categories in three G-8 countries, including Germany (71 percent), England (67 percent), and Italy (51 percent). For the category of more than 3 and up to and including 6 hours of reading instruction, the percentages ranged from 22 percent in the United States to 60 percent in the russian Federation. This category was reported more frequently than the other two categories in two G-8 countries, including the russian Federation (60 percent) and France (48 percent). For the category of more than 6 hours of reading instruction, the percentages ranged from 6 percent in Germany to 68 percent in the United States. The United States not only had the highest percentage of fourth-graders with teachers who reported spending more than 6 hours on reading instruction in a typical week, but it also was the only participating G-8 country to cite this category more frequently than any other category. Data for this indicator are from the PIrLS 2006 fourth-grade teacher questionnaire, which was administered to the teachers of the students sampled for PIrLS. The questionnaire included questions on teachers' background and on their teaching practices in the sampled students' classes. One or two classes were randomly sampled in each school, and teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire for each class they taught that contained sampled students. Thus, if a teacher taught two classes with sampled students, he or she was expected to complete a questionnaire for each of these classes. It should be noted that the PIrLS 2006 fourth-grade teachers do not constitute representative samples of teachers. rather, they are the teachers for nationally representative samples of fourth-grade students. Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. In PIrLS 2006, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, France,Germany,Italy,Russian Federation,Scotland,United States providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. As defined by PIrLS, the 1st year of formal schooling begins with the 1st year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. Note that kindergarten is not counted. For most countries, the target grade was fourth grade, or its national equivalent.\nTeachers' reports of how much time in a typical week is spent on reading instruction are based on the following question: \"regardless of whether or not you have formally scheduled time for reading instruction, in a typical week about how much time do you spend on reading instruction and/or activities with the students? Include things you do across curriculum areas and during formally scheduled time for reading instruction.\" Teachers were asked to write in the hours and minutes per week.  PIrLS 2006), this indicator presents teachers' reports about the strategies that they used to help fourth-graders having difficulty reading. Teachers were given a list of strategies and asked whether each one was used if a student begins to fall behind in reading. In 2006, a combination of strategies was reportedly used to varying degrees in the participating G-8 countries 19 to assist students having difficulty reading. One of the most common strategies was to ask parents to help their child with reading (table 4). The percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported asking parents to help their child with reading ranged from 84 percent in France to 99 percent in the russian Federation and England. In the United States, this strategy was used more frequently than any of the others; 97 percent of fourth-graders had a teacher who reported using it. A second strategy commonly used to assist students having difficulty reading was working with students individually. The percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported working with students individually ranged from 78 percent in England to 92 percent in Scotland and Italy. In the United States, 89 percent of fourth-graders had a teacher who reported doing this. In Italy, Scotland, and France, working with students individually was done about as frequently as asking the parents to help their child with reading. A third strategy commonly used by several G-8 countries to assist students having difficulty reading was to have the student work with other students; its reported use ranged from 45 percent in Scotland to 83 percent in Italy. In the United States 80 percent of fourth-graders had a teacher who reported using this strategy. There were a few strategies for assisting students having difficulty reading where reported use varied considerably across the G-8 countries. For example, the percentage of fourth-graders who had a teacher who reported assigning homework to help the student catch up ranged from 23 percent in France to 94 percent in the russian Federation, with the United States at 45 percent. The reported use of the strategy of having the student work in the regular classroom with a teacher aide ranged from 8 percent in Germany to 72 percent in England, with the United States at 31 percent. The reported use of the strategy of waiting to see if performance improves with maturation ranged from 17 percent in Scotland to 65 percent in the russian Federation, with the United States at 32 percent. A reading specialist may also be used to assist students having difficulty reading. In most of the G-8 countries, this was more likely to take place in a remedial classroom than in the regular classroom. For example, in England, the United States, and Scotland, about half of fourth-graders had a teacher who reported having students work in a remedial classroom with a reading specialist, which compares to 28, 15, and 18 percent, respectively, for having students work in the regular classroom with a reading specialist. PIrLS also asked teachers of fourth-graders about their access to remedial reading specialists. Thirty-four percent of fourth-graders in the United States and 24 percent of fourth-graders in England had teachers who reported always having a remedial reading specialist available (figure 15). Less than 10 percent of fourth-graders in France, Germany, and Italy had teachers who reported always having a remedial reading specialist available. England had the lowest percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers never had access to a remedial reading specialist (16 percent), while Italy had the highest (95 percent). In the United States, 29 percent of fourth-graders had teachers who reported never having access to a remedial reading specialist.\nData for this indicator are from the PIrLS 2006 fourth-grade teacher questionnaire, which was administered to the teachers of the students sampled for PIrLS. The questionnaire included questions on teachers' background and on their teaching practices in the sampled students' classes. One or two classes were randomly sampled in each school, and teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire for each class they taught that contained sampled students. Thus, if a teacher taught two classes with sampled students, he or she was expected to complete a questionnaire for each of these classes. It should be noted that the PIrLS 2006 fourth-grade teachers do not constitute representative samples of teachers. rather, they are the teachers for nationally representative samples of fourth-grade students. Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. In PIrLS 2006, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. As defined by PIrLS, the 1st year of formal schooling begins with the 1st year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. Note that kindergarten is not counted. For most countries, the target grade was fourth grade, or its national equivalent. Teachers' reports about whether or not they used various strategies to help fourth-graders who are having difficulty reading are based on the percentages of students whose teachers responded \"yes\" to a list of strategies that follow the question, \"What do you usually do if a student begins to fall behind in reading?\" Teachers' reports about the availability of remedial reading specialists to assist fourth-graders who are having difficulty reading were based on teachers' responses to the question, \"Are the following resources available to you to deal with students who have difficulty with reading?\" As shown in figure 15, results are based on the percentages of students whose teachers responded \"always,\" \"sometimes,\" or \"never\" to the availability of a remedial reading specialist either in the classroom or in a remedial reading classroom.  \nData for this indicator are from the PIrLS fourth-grade teacher questionnaire, which was administered to the teachers of the students sampled for PIrLS in 2001 and 2006. The questionnaire included questions on teachers' background and on their teaching practices in the sampled students' classes. One or two classes were randomly sampled in each school, and teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire for each class they taught that contained sampled students. Thus, if a teacher taught two classes with sampled students, he or she was expected to complete a questionnaire for each of these classes. It should be noted that the PIrLS fourth-grade teachers do not constitute representative samples of teachers in 2001 and 2006. rather, they are the teachers for nationally representative samples of fourth-grade students. Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. In PIrLS 2006, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. As defined by PIrLS, the 1st year of formal schooling  begins with the 1st year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. Note that kindergarten is not counted. For most countries, the target grade was fourth grade, or its national equivalent. For teachers' reports of their age, teachers were given the following response options in the PIrLS teacher questionnaire: (1) under 25; (2) 25 to 29; (3) 30 to 39; (4) 40 to 49; (5) 50 to 59; or (6) 60 or more. For the purposes of this indicator, the bottom two categories were combined and the top two categories were combined. The categories of \"29 years or younger\" and \"50 years or older\" were used in this indicator in order to highlight the percentage of fourth-graders with beginning teachers and the percentage with teachers nearing retirement. As presented in the text or shown in figure 16a, differences from 2001 to 2006 were computed from unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from computations made using the rounded numbers cited in the text or shown in figure 16b.\nIn this indicator, the term \"teaching hours\" refers to \"net teaching hours,\" which are calculated as follows: annual number of weeks of instruction multiplied by the minimum/maximum number of periods that a teacher is supposed to spend teaching a class or group multiplied by the length of a period in minutes and divided by 60. Periods of time formally allowed for breaks between lessons or group of lessons, and days when schools are closed for public holidays and festivities, are excluded. Working time refers to the normal working hours of a full-time teacher. According to the formal policy in a given country, working time can refer either to the time directly associated with teaching (and other curricular \u2022 activities for students such as administering assignments and tests, but excluding annual examinations); or the time directly associated with teaching as well as the time \u2022 devoted to other activities related to teaching (such as lesson preparation, counseling students, correcting assignments and tests, professional development, meetings with parents, staff meetings, and general school tasks). Working time does not include paid overtime. Working time required at school refers to the working time teachers are supposed to be at school, including teaching time and nonteaching time. Statutory working time refers to the normal working hours of a fulltime teacher and includes net teaching hours (i.e., the time directly associated with teaching) as well as nonteaching hours devoted to activities related to teaching, such as lesson preparation, counseling students, and correcting assignments and tests. Statutory working time may include nonteaching time not spent at school. Teaching staff include professional personnel directly involved in teaching students. The classification includes classroom teachers; special education teachers; and other teachers who work with a whole class of students in a classroom, in small groups in a resource room, or in one-to-one teaching situations inside or outside a regular classroom. Teaching staff also includes department chairpersons whose duties include some teaching, but excludes non-professional personnel who support teachers in providing instruction to students, such as teachers' aides and other paraprofessional personnel.\nData for this indicator are from the TIMSS 2007 teacher questionnaire, which was designed to obtain information about the classroom contexts for the teaching and learning of mathematics and science and about the implemented curriculum in these subjects. For each participating school, one teacher questionnaire that addressed both mathematics and science was administered to the classroom teacher of the sampled fourth-grade class, and separate versions of the questionnaire were administered to the mathematics teacher and the science teacher of the sampled eighth-grade class. It should be noted that the TIMSS 2007 teachers do not constitute representative samples of teachers. rather, they are the teachers for nationally representative samples of fourth-grade and eighth-grade students. Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. In TIMSS 2007 at fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling (the end of primary school), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. At eighth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 8 years of formal schooling (the end of lower secondary education), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 13.5 years.\nData for this indicator are from the TIMSS 2007 teacher questionnaire, which was designed to obtain information about the classroom contexts for the teaching and learning of mathematics and science and about the implemented curriculum in these subjects.

At eighth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 8 years of formal schooling (the end of lower secondary education), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 13.5 years.\nData for this indicator are from the PISA 2006 school questionnaire, which was designed to obtain information about a variety of school-related aspects, including school characteristics, the school's resources, the student body, teachers in the school, pedagogical practices of the school, and administrative structures within the school. At all schools with participating 15-year-old students, a school questionnaire was administered to the principal. It should be noted that the PISA 2006 principals do not constitute representative samples of principals. rather, they are the principals for nationally representative samples of 15-year-old students. Thus, the school data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. In PISA, \"15-year-olds\" refers to students between 15 years and 3 months to 16 years and 2 months old at the time of the assessment and who have completed at least 6 years of formal schooling. As stated in the school questionnaire, achievement data include aggregated school or grade-level test scores or grades, or graduation rates.  In 2007, about 39 percent of U.S. eighth-graders had principals who reported at least a weekly occurrence of intimidation or verbal abuse of other students, which is higher than in all other participating G-8 countries. Using eighth-grade data from the 2007 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS 2007), this indicator presents school principals' reports of both the incidence of behaviors that threaten a safe and orderly environment and their perceptions of these behaviors as a \"serious\" problem. It should be noted that what constitutes a \"serious\" problem may differ from one country to another. A relatively low number of threatening behaviors may be perceived as a \"serious\" problem in one country, but not in another, because of cultural differences and other factors. Of the seven problem behaviors shown in figure 21a, classroom disturbance was the most frequently cited in the United States. Across the participating G-8 countries, 24 the percentage of eighthgraders whose principals reported at least a weekly occurrence of a classroom disturbance ranged from 8 percent in Japan to 60 percent in Scotland, with the United States at 55 percent. The U.S. percentage was higher than in the russian Federation and Japan but not measurably different from that in the other participating G-8 countries. The U.S. percentage for classroom disturbance in 2007 was lower than in 1999, when 69 percent of U.S. eighth-graders were in schools whose principals reported at least a weekly occurrence of a classroom disturbance (see indicator 14 in Sherman, Honegger, and McGivern 2003). In 2007, intimidation or verbal abuse of other students was cited second most frequently in the United States. The percentage of eighth-graders in schools whose principals reported at least a weekly occurrence of intimidation or verbal abuse of other students ranged from 1 percent in the russian Federation to 39 percent in the United States, with the U.S. percentage higher than in all other participating G-8 countries. In Japan, compared with other participating G-8 countries, relatively low percentages of eighth-graders had principals who reported problem behaviors occurring at least weekly, with a range from 1 percent for both cheating and theft to 8 percent for classroom disturbance. There were lower percentages of students in Japan than in England, Italy, Scotland, and the United States whose principals reported that classroom disturbances and intimidation or verbal abuse of other students occurred at least weekly. Figure 21b shown principals' perceptions of these behaviors as a \"serious\" problem. In the United States in 2007, intimidation or verbal abuse of other students was cited most frequently as a serious problem (26 percent), followed by classroom disturbance (17 percent). 25 The percentage of U.S. eighth-graders whose principals reported intimidation or verbal abuse of other students as a serious problem was about 10 percentage points higher in 2007 than in 1999 (see indicator 14 in Sherman, Honegger, and McGivern 2003). In 2007, the percentages of eighth-graders in Japan whose principals reported the problem behaviors as serious problems ranged from 24 percent for cheating to 39 percent for intimidation or verbal abuse of other students. No particular behavior was cited most frequently as a serious problem in Japan (i.e., no measurable differences at the high end of the range). In Italy, the percentages of eighth-graders whose principals reported the problem behaviors as serious problems ranged from 8 percent for cheating to 31 percent for classroom disturbance. Classroom disturbance was cited more frequently as a serious problem in Italy than all other behaviors except intimidation or verbal abuse of other students (there was no measurable difference in reports of these two behaviors as serious problems). In England, the russian Federation, and Scotland, the percentages of eighth-graders whose principals reported the problem behaviors as serious problems were no higher than 8 percent for all of the behaviors.\nData for this indicator are from the TIMSS 2007 eighth-grade school questionnaire, which asked school principals of the eighth-graders tested to provide information about curricular and instructional arrangements, school resources, and school climate. It should be noted that the TIMSS 2007 school principals do not constitute representative samples of school principals. rather, they are the school principals for nationally representative samples of eighthgrade students. Thus, the school data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. Countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 8 years of formal schooling (the end of lower secondary education), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 13.5 years. As the data for this indicator, school principals were asked the following questions on the eighth-grade school questionnaire: \"How often does each of the following problem behaviors occur among eighth-grade students in your school? If the behavior occurs, how severe a problem does it present?\" The behaviors specified in the question were as follows: arriving late at school; absenteeism (i.e., unjustified absences); skipping class hours/periods; violating dress code; classroom disturbance; cheating; profanity; vandalism; theft; intimidation or verbal abuse of other students; physical injury to other students; intimidation or verbal abuse of teachers or staff; and physical injury to teachers or staff. The results for seven of these problem behaviors are presented in this indicator. response options for frequency included \"never,\" \"rarely,\" \"monthly,\" \"weekly,\" and \"daily.\" For this analysis, the latter two categories were combined. response options for the severity of the problem included \"not a problem,\" \"minor problem,\" and \"serious problem.\" For the reports of a behavior as a serious problem, the denominator for the percentages is students at all schools, not just students at schools whose principals report the occurrence of the behavior at least weekly.  This indicator presents a cross-country comparison of the average annual salaries of full-time public school teachers with the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified at the beginning of their teaching careers. Comparisons are presented across two education levels: primary and upper secondary. The indicator also compares the ratio of these average starting salaries to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for each of the reporting countries. Of the G-8 countries reporting data in 2006, Germany reported the highest average starting salary of public school teachers at both the primary and upper secondary levels (primary: $40,300; upper secondary: $45,200) (figure 22). The United States paid the second highest average starting salary to public school teachers at both levels (primary: $34,900; upper secondary: $33,700). France reported the lowest average starting salary at both levels (primary: $23,300; upper secondary: $26,000). In most G-8 countries in 2006, public school teachers at the beginning of their careers earned less than the average GDP per capita in their respective countries (table  6). For example, in the United States, the GDP per capita was about $43,800, and the average starting salary of such teachers was about 80 percent of the U.S. GDP per capita. In Germany, however, public primary and upper secondary school teachers at the beginning of their careers earned 126 and 141 percent, respectively, of the German GDP per capita. Included: England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Scotland, United States Definitions and Methodology Teacher salary data are from the 2007 OECD Indicators of National Education Systems (INES) Survey on Teachers and the Curriculum and refer to the school year 2005-06. Data for GDP per capita are for calendar year 2006. Dollar figures for teacher salaries and GDP per capita were converted to U.S. equivalent dollars using purchasing power parities (PPPs), which equalize the purchasing power of different currencies. PPP exchange rate data are from the 2005-06 OECD National Accounts Database (OECD 2008b). Using PPPs to convert all teacher salary data to US equivalent dollars allows for cost of living differences across countries to be taken into account.\nPer student expenditure is based on public and private full-timeequivalent (FTE) enrollment figures for the 2004-05 school year and current expenditure and capital outlays from both public and private sources, where data are available. Data for GDP per capita are for calendar year 2005. Dollar figures for education expenditure and GDP per capita were converted to U.S. equivalent dollars using purchasing power parities (PPPs), which equalize the purchasing power of different currencies. Using PPPs to convert all education expenditure data to US equivalent dollars allows for cost of living differences across countries to be taken into account. Within-country consumer price indices are used to adjust the PPP indices to account for inflation because the fiscal year has a different starting date in different countries. The national averages shown here do not represent the withincountry variation that may exist in the annual education expenditure per student. As shown in the figures, education levels are defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97).

The summations presented in the text were carried out using unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from summations made using the rounded numbers that appear in figure 25.   In the United States and all other G-8 countries reporting data, higher employment rates were associated with higher levels of educational attainment. In all reporting countries except the United Kingdom, between 52 and 58 percent of adults ages 25 to 64 whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below were employed in 2006 (figure 26a). This compares to a range from 73 to 76 percent for adults whose highest educational attainment was upper secondary education 27 and from 81 to 86 percent for adults who had completed academic higher education, excluding the United Kingdom. For example, among U.S. adults in 2006, about 58 percent of those whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below were employed, compared with 73 percent of those whose highest educational attainment was upper secondary education and 83 percent of those who had completed academic higher education. The United Kingdom had higher employment rates than all other reporting G-8 countries at all three levels of educational attainment (66, 81, and 89 percent, respectively). The gaps in employment rates for 25-to 64-year-olds at the highest and lowest levels of educational attainment (i.e., the difference in the employment rates for academic higher education and lower secondary education or below), ranged from 23 percentage points in the United Kingdom and France to 31 percentage points in Germany (figure 26a). In the United States, the gap was 25 percentage points. Figure 26b shows employment rates separately for males and females. In all reporting G-8 countries, males who had completed lower secondary education or below, upper secondary education, or academic higher education had higher employment rates than did females with a comparable amount of education. For males whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below, employment rates ranged from 65 percent (Germany) to 72 percent (the United Kingdom). For females, the corresponding range was 33 percent (Italy) to 61 percent (the United Kingdom). In the United States, 70 percent of males and 44 percent of females whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below were employed in 2006. For males whose highest educational attainment was upper secondary education, employment rates ranged from 78 percent (Germany) to 87 percent (Japan). For females, the corresponding range was 60 percent (Japan) to 76 percent (United Kingdom). In the United States, 80 percent of males and 67 percent of females whose highest educational attainment was upper secondary education were employed in 2006. In all reporting G-8 countries, at least 85 percent of males who had completed academic higher education were employed in 2006. For females who had completed academic higher education, employment rates ranged from 68 percent (Japan) to 87 percent (United Kingdom). In the United States, 88 percent of males and 78 percent of females who had completed academic higher education were employed in 2006. In most of the reporting G-8 countries, the gap in employment rates between males and females was largest among adults whose highest educational attainment was lower secondary education or below and smallest among adults who had completed academic higher education. In all reporting G-8 countries except Japan, the male-female gap for lower secondary education or below was approximately two to four times the size of the gap for academic higher education. Italy had the largest male-female gap at the level of lower secondary education or below (38 percentage points). In Japan, the male-female gap was 28 percentage points among adults who had completed upper secondary education and 27 percentage points among adults who had completed academic higher education; these gaps were larger than those in all other reporting G-8 countries at these levels. In the United States, the male-female gap was 27, 13, and 10 percentage points among adults who had completed lower secondary education or below, upper secondary education, and academic higher education, respectively.\nThe employment rate of adults at a particular level of educational attainment is calculated as the number of individuals ages 25 to 64 with the particular level of educational attainment who are in employment divided by the number of individuals ages 25 to 64 with the same level of educational attainment. As shown in the figures, education levels are defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97). For more information on the ISCED97 levels, see appendix A. Individuals whose highest level of education is academic higher education have completed at least a first university degree program, which prepares students for advanced research and highly qualified professions.

On the TIMSS 2007 fourth-grade science assessment, average scale scores ranged from 500 in Scotland to 548 in Japan (Gonzales et al. 2008). Fourth-graders in Japan scored higher, on average, than their peers in Scotland, Germany, Italy, and the United States, but not measurably different from their peers in England and the russian Federation. The percentages of fourth-graders who reached the highest benchmark in science, advanced, ranged from 4 percent in Scotland to 16 percent in the russian Federation (figure 8). In the United States, 15 percent of fourth-graders reached the advanced benchmark, a higher percentage than in Germany and Scotland. The percentages of fourth-graders at or above the high benchmark in science ranged from 26 percent in Scotland to 51 percent in Japan. In the United States, 47 percent of fourth-graders reached the high benchmark, a larger percentage than in Germany and Scotland but smaller than in Japan. Eighty-six percent of fourth-graders in Japan were at or above the intermediate benchmark in science. This was higher than in all other participating G-8 countries, where the percentages ranged from 65 percent in Scotland to 82 percent in the russian Federation. In the United States, 78 percent of fourth-graders met the intermediate benchmark, a higher percentage than only Scotland. At eighth grade, students in Japan scored higher overall in science and generally had larger percentages of students reaching each of the four international benchmarks compared to their G-8 peers. A greater percentage of eighth-graders in England and Japan than in all other participating G-8 countries reached the advanced benchmark in science. Seventeen percent of eighth-graders in England and Japan reached the advanced benchmark, compared to a range from 4 percent in Italy to 11 percent in the russian Federation.

International comparisons of salaries provide simplified illustrations of the compensation received by teachers for their work. They provide a snapshot of the systems of compensation and the welfare inferences that can be made. Differences by country in taxation and social benefit systems as well as the use of financial incentives (including regional allowances for teaching in remote regions, family allowances, reduced rates on public transport, tax allowances on purchases of cultural goods, and other entitlements that contribute to a teacher's basic income) make it important to exercise caution in interpreting comparisons of teachers' salaries. Countries with centralized systems of education typically have national salary schedules. In countries like the United States, with decentralized education systems, local or regional governments establish their own salary schedules. The national averages shown here do not represent the within-country variation that exists in teacher salaries. The minimum training necessary to be fully qualified varies by country.

The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) measured the occupational status of the 15-year-old student's mother or father (whichever parent had the higher occupational status), with parental occupation reported by the student. Parental occupations were translated into index scores. A low index score (i.e., between 16 and 34 points) corresponds with a parental occupation requiring a minimal level of education (e.g., taxi driver, waiter/waitress), and a high index score (i.e., between 71 and 90 points) corresponds with a parental occupation requiring a high level of education (e.g., medical doctor, university professor). This indicator focuses on the relationship between parent occupational status and science achievement as measured in PISA 2006. results from PISA showed that U.S. students tended to come from homes with parents whose occupations required comparatively higher levels of education relative to their peers in other G-8 countries. In 2006, the United States and Canada had the highest mean occupational index scores of all the G-8 countries, which is similar to what was found in PISA in 2003. 15 In 2006, the range across the G-8 countries was from 46.4 in Italy to 53.5 in Canada, with the United States at 52.5 (OECD 2007b). Furthermore, when students were classified into national quarters on the occupational index, U.S. 15-year-olds in the bottom national quarter had a higher mean index score than their peers in Italy, France, Germany, and the russian Federation (29.9 in the United States compared to a range from 27.2 in Italy to 29.5 in the russian Federation). In Canada and Japan, students in the bottom national quarter had a higher mean index score (32.7 and 34.2, respectively) than their U.S. counterparts. These results showed that parent occupational status was generally higher for U.S. students compared to their G-8 peers. Among those students from families with low occupational status relative to other students in their country, U.S. students tended to have parents whose occupations required comparatively higher levels of education relative to their peers in other G-8 countries. On the other hand, when looking at the science achievement of those students from families with low occupational status, U.S. students did not perform higher than their counterparts in any G-8 country. U.S. students in the bottom national quarter of the occupational index were outperformed by students in the bottom national quarter of the index in the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and Japan on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale (445 in the United States compared to a range from 472 in the United Kingdom to 506 in Japan) (figure 12a). Nevertheless, within all G-8 countries, there was a relationship between parent occupational status and students' achievement scores. Specifically, students in the top national quarter of the occupational index scored higher on the combined science literacy scale than students in the bottom national quarter of the index. This difference ranged from 53 points in Japan to 111 points in France; in the United States, this difference was 97 points. Another way to evaluate the relationship between parent occupational status and science achievement is to examine the specific change in score on the combined science literacy scale in response to a one-standard-deviation increase (i.e., 17.1 units) in the occupational index score. A greater increase in a country's average achievement score per one-standard-deviation increase in the occupational index score implies a stronger relationship between parent occupational status and performance in that country. Across the G-8 countries, an increase of one standard deviation on the index was associated with an average performance increase that ranged from 19 score points in Japan to 42 score points in France (figure 12b). In the United States, an increase of one standard deviation on the index was associated with an average performance increase of 36 score points. Compared to the United States, four G-8 countries had a weaker relationship between the occupational index and science literacy performance-Japan, the russian Federation, Canada, and Italy-and the other G-8 countries were not measurably different from the United States in this regard."}, {"section_title": "Indicator 12", "text": "In all G-8 countries with data shown 17 except the russian Federation, 15-year-old students with an immigrant background scored lower, on average, on the PISA 2006 combined science literacy scale than their native peers (figure 13b).

Although teachers in the United States were contracted to teach more hours than their peers in the other reporting G-8 countries, they worked less total hours (teaching time plus related nonteaching time) than their peers in Japan and Germany. This indicator presents two measures of teachers' average working time per year: (1) teaching hours-the amount of time spent instructing students, and 2working time-the total amount of time spent teaching and doing other work-related activites (e.g., preparing lessons and correcting assignments and tests). It should be noted that these results are generally based on the amount of time that teachers are contracted to work and do not take into account the possible variation in the number of hours teachers actually work. In 2006, teachers in the United States at the primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary levels were contracted to teach an average of 1,080 hours during the school year (figure 17). This was more than in any other G-8 country reporting data at these three levels. Besides the United States, the only other reporting G-8 country with the same number of teaching hours at the three education levels was Scotland (893 hours). In France, Germany, and Italy, primary school teachers were contracted to work more teaching hours than lower and upper secondary teachers; of these three countries, France reported the greatest differential, with 276 more hours for primary school teachers than for lower secondary school teachers, and 294 more hours for primary school teachers than for upper secondary school teachers. The only reporting G-8 country in which primary school teachers spent fewer contracted hours teaching than lower and upper secondary teachers was the russian Federation, with 290 fewer hours for primary school teachers. regulations on working time vary across the G-8 countries (see table 5).

Germany, Japan and Scotland specify statutory working time, which can occur at school or elsewhere. Although teachers in the United States were contracted to teach more hours than their peers in the other reporting G-8 countries, they worked less total hours than their peers in Japan and Germany when working time was defined not only as time spent on teaching but also as time spent on other work-related activities.

In this indicator, two measures are used to compare countries' investment in education: (1) expenditure per student (expressed in absolute terms) from both public and private sources and 2total expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). The latter measure allows a comparison of countries' expenditure relative to their presumed ability to financially support education. In 2005, expenditure per student for the United States was about $9,800 at the combined primary and secondary education levels and about $24,400 at the higher education level (figure 23a). Both figures were higher than those in the five other G-8 countries reporting data, which ranged from about $6,900 in Germany and the United Kingdom to $7,500 in France at the combined primary and secondary levels and from about $8,000 in Italy to $13,500 in the United Kingdom at the higher education level. In 2005, all the countries spent more money (i.e., in total dollars as a percentage of GDP) at the combined primary and secondary education levels than at the higher education level, where the student enrollment is much lower (figure 23b).

Among 25-to 34-year-olds, more females than males had completed higher education in every G-8 country except Germany, where there was no difference. This indicator compares the highest levels of education attained by 25-to 64-year-olds in 2006 and also examines rates of young adult (ages 25 to 34) completion of higher education by sex. results for 25-to 64-year-olds were analyzed at three levels of educational attainment: lower secondary education or below, upper secondary education, 26 and higher education. Italy was the only G-8 country in which the largest percentage (48 percent) of 25-to 64-year-olds had completed lower secondary education or below as their highest level of educational attainment (figure 24a). In half of the G-8 countries (France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States), the largest percentage of 25-to 64-year-olds had completed upper secondary education as their highest level of education. In the russian Federation and Canada, the largest percentage of 25-to 64-year-olds had completed higher education (54 and 47 percent, respectively). In all G-8 countries except the russian Federation, less than half of 25-to 64-year-olds had completed higher education, with percentages ranging from 13 percent in Italy to 47 percent in Canada. In the United States, 39 percent of 25-to 64-year-olds had completed higher education. Compared to 25-to 64-year-olds, larger percentages of the subgroup of young adults (ages 25 to 34) had completed higher education in most of the G-8 countries. For example, in Canada and Japan, more than half of 25-to 34-year-olds had completed higher education, compared with 47 and 40 percent, respectively, of 25-to 64-year-olds (figures 24a and 24b). In France, 41 percent of 25-to 34-year-olds had completed higher education, compared with 26 percent of 25-to 64-year-olds. In the United States, both age groups had the same percentage of higher education completion in 2006 (39 percent). In the United States, more bachelor's degrees have been awarded to women than to men since about the early 1980s (U.S. Department of Education 2008). Among 25-to 34-year-olds in the United States in 2006, about 36 percent of males and 43 percent of females had completed higher education (figure 24b). More 25-to 34-year-old females than males had completed higher education in every G-8 country except Germany, where there was no measurable difference. The largest differences by sex were reported in Canada, the russian Federation, and France (14, 12, and 10 percentage points, respectively). Among 25-to 34-year-olds in the G-8 countries, differences favoring females in higher education completion were generally more consistent and pronounced in 2006 compared to 5 years prior. For example, in 2001, slightly more 25-to 34-year-old males than females in the United Kingdom and Germany had completed higher education (a difference of 1 and 3 percentage points, respectively) (OECD 2003). In 2001, higher education completion in Italy, Japan, and France differed in favor of females by 3 to 5 percentage points; in 2006, these differences ranged from 6 to 10 percentage points (figure 24b)."}, {"section_title": "United States", "text": "Higher education 6 Upper secondary education 5 Lower secondary education or below 4 1 Reference year is 2003 rather than 2006. 2 The United Kingdom includes England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.

Programs that prepare students for advanced research and highly qualified professions are called first university degree programs. First university degree programs vary in duration in different countries in different programs of study. In the United States, this corresponds to a bachelor's degree but excludes associate's degrees. This indicator compares the percentage of first degrees awarded in four major fields of study: social sciences, business, and law; science, mathematics, and engineering; the arts and humanities; and education. In 2006, a greater percentage of first university degrees were awarded in the field of social sciences, business, and law than in any other field in all G-8 countries (figure 25). The russian Federation awarded the highest percentage of first university degrees in this combined field (50 percent), which exceeded that awarded in the other major fields in total-arts and humanities; science, mathematics, and engineering; and education (41 percent). In the other G-8 countries, the percentage of first university degrees awarded in the combined field of social sciences, business, and law ranged from 28 percent in Germany to 42 percent in the United States. In science, mathematics, and engineering-related fields, the United States awarded among the lowest percentages of first university degrees of all the G-8 countries. Sixteen percent of first university degrees in the United States and 17 percent of first university degrees in Canada were awarded in science, mathematics, and engineering-related fields. In the other G-8 countries, the percentages ranged from 20 percent in Japan to 27 percent in Germany. The United States was the only G-8 country to award more first university degrees in the arts and humanities than in science, mathematics, and engineering. In 2006, about 19 percent of first university degrees were awarded to U.S. graduates in arts and humanities (compared to 16 percent in science, mathematics, and engineering). The russian Federation awarded the lowest percentage of first university degrees in the arts and humanities (4 percent); in the other G-8 countries, the percentages ranged from 15 percent in Canada and Italy to 22 percent in Germany. The smallest percentage of first university degrees was awarded in the field of education in all G-8 countries except the russian Federation. The russian Federation was the only G-8 country to award more first university degrees in education than in the arts and humanities (12 vs. 4 percent). Canada awarded the highest percentage of first university degrees in education (13 percent), while France and the United Kingdom awarded the lowest percentages in this field (both at 4 percent).

The ISCED97 levels address the intent (e.g., to study basic subjects or prepare students for university) of each year of a particular education system, but do not indicate the depth or rigor of study in that year. Thus, the ISCED97 is useful when comparing the age range of students in upper secondary schools across nations; however, it does not indicate whether the curriculum and standards are equivalent within the same year of schooling across nations. The ISCED97 allows researchers to compile statistics on education internationally. The ISCED97 levels are as follows: ISCED97 level 0 is classified as preprimary education. This is \u2022 defined as the initial stage of organized instruction, designed primarily to introduce very young children to a school-type environment. ISCED97 level 0 programs can either be center or school based. Preschool and kindergarten programs in the United States fall into the level 0 category, although kindergarten is typically considered an elementary grade in the United States. ISCED97 level 1 consists of primary education, which usually \u2022 lasts 4 to 6 years. ISCED97 level 1 typically begins between ages 5 and 7, and is the stage where students begin to study basic subjects, such as reading, writing, and mathematics. There are differences within the education systems of some G-8 countries because responsibilities and oversight for education take place at the regional or local level. However, the charts and accompanying text in this appendix are intended to give the reader a general overview of the education system of each G-8 country, from the preprimary to the doctoral level. As indicated in the source note for each country chart, the information summarizing each country's education system comes largely from the previous Comparative Indicators report (2006). However, some modifications were made based on updated online resources and comments received from international reviewers.

In the United States, bachelor's, master's, and first professional degree programs are classified as ISCED97 level 5A. ISCED97 level 5B refers to vocational higher education. Level 5B programs provide a higher level of career and technical education and are designed to prepare students for the labor market. In the international classification, these programs last 2 to 4 years. In the United States, associate's degree programs are classified at this level.

NOTE: After the first 2 years of upper secondary school, students take General Certificate of Secondary Education qualifications (GCSEs), typically at age 16. They then have the option of continuing school for 2 years, often called the sixth form. Some schools do not offer the sixth form, in which case students can transfer to a sixth form college (which is similar but in a separate school) or go to a further education college. Sixth forms usually offer General Certificate of Education Advanced Subsidiary qualifications (GCE AS levels) at age 17 and General Certificate of Education Advanced level examinations (GCE A levels) at age 18. GCE A levels are usually required for entry to higher education. An increasing range of GCSEs, A levels, and AS levels in applied (vocational) subjects is also being offered, along with a developing range of 14-19 Diplomas. Such 14-19 Diplomas involve part-time or fulltime programs that combine vocational and academic studies in broad subject areas.

Comparative Indicators of Education in the United States andOther G-8 Countries: 2006 (NCES 2007-006 NOTE: There are different types of secondary schools, some combining Hauptschule and Realschule. The secondary school a student in Germany attends is determined by a combination of factors, depending on the L\u00e4nder: admissions tests, previous grade point average, teacher recommendations, and parents' wishes. The degree of flexibility that parents have in choosing which educational track their child enters also varies between regions. However, the type of school a student attends is sometimes less important than the chosen track: at the end of lower secondary, all students who meet the requirements receive a leaving certificate. At the Hauptschule it is generally the Hauptschulabschluss, but students who excel may receive a Realschulabschluss (called the Mittlere Schulabschluss in some L\u00e4nder). At the Realschule, students typically receive the Realschulabschluss; at the Gesamtschule, both types of diplomas are offered. All students attending Gymnasium who advance to the upper secondary level automatically receive the Realschulabschluss. Some L\u00e4nder also have an orientation phase during the first 2 years of lower secondary school, which gives parents and teachers 2 more years to decide a child's educational path.
